# CUBESAT USING ARDUINIO 

A Picosatellite is made of dimension 10cm x 10cm x 10 cm (1U CUBESAT) using arduino development board with a open source architecture. 

## Getting Started

The core components of the picosatellite are  chassis, Micro Controller Unit, Sensors. We will design and fabricate the cubesat chassis using 3D printer technology. To recieve and detect various data from IMU sensors. Work has been made for this project to get data from the sensors using Arduino IDE and python is used to visualize, plot live data graph and to store data.
